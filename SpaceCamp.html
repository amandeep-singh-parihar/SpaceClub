    <h1>Space Camp</h2>
    <p style="font-size:x-large;">Space Club organises space camps frequently. The events are organised at different locations such as different Cyber Parks, Sargaalaya Craft Village, University of Calicut and NIT Kozhikode. The events are attended by eminent scientists from ISRO and other reputed organizations. The participation to the event is restricted to space club members only. An online learning platform for all ages developed by a team of educationists, science communicators, and astronomers. A unit of SPACE Group, established in 2001. The trademark of SPACE is innovation, passion, and total commitment to spreading knowledge of astronomy and space sciences to the public. Every project in SPACE is an opportunity for us to communicate our belief in developing scientific temperament to people, especially children, to create an intelligent and analytic global community. SPACE has successfully implemented astronomy and space science curriculum in the Indian education system. In this context, we have developed a variety of astronomy and space science educational concepts through astronomy projects, sessions, tutorials, and modules based on school/college curriculum for education, catering to the needs of schools & students in India.</p>

        <p style="font-size:x-large;">In our Space Club, special interventions are made to develop sky watch as a culture among all our student members. As the name suggests, it is all about analyzing the changes that happen in the sky at different time intervals. Training will be provided in this regard by providing the students with appropriate materials needed for the same. Sky Safari is organized every time as part of our Space Camps wherein experts from within and outside India will guide our students in that area. This amateur astronomy community is guided by Shri Surendran Punnasseri, a famous amateur astronomer from India.</p>

The selected students will be taken to the ISRO Space Research Centre, where they can explore each department and have direct interactions with the scientists, physicists and cosmologists from all around the world. The main aim of this program is to provide an exposure to students about the practical working environment and to help them gain full awareness about the practices in the space industry</p>
